### New user-visible features

- (applications) - Attributes `RemoteAddress` and `RemotePort` in UdpClient, UdpTraceClient and UdpEchoClient have been combined into a single `Remote` attribute. Similarly, the `ThreeGppHttpClient::RemoteServerAddress` and `ThreeGppHttpClient::RemoteServerPort` attributes have been combined into a single `ThreeGppHttpClient::Remote` attribute. The constructors of corresponding helper classes have been changed to make use of these new attributes.
- (applications) - The `ThreeGppHttpServer::LocalAddress` and `ThreeGppHttpServer::LocalPort` attributes have been renamed to `ThreeGppHttpServer::Remote` and `ThreeGppHttpServer::Port`, respectively.
- (applications) - It is now possible to specify the address on which to bind the listening socket for UdpServer via the `Local` attribute.
- (applications) - It is now possible to specify a port only for PacketSink to listen to any address (both IPv4 and IPv6).
- (build) Scan for contrib modules in `ns-3-external-contrib` directory, at the same level of the ns-3 directory (e.g. `./ns-3-dev/../ns-3-external-contrib/`).
- (energy) Added new information and reformatted energy module documentation.
- (wifi) - Added a `WifiDefaultProtectionManager::SkipMuRtsBeforeBsrp` attribute to avoid using MU-RTS to protect the transmission of a BSRP Trigger Frame. If this attribute is set to true (which is the default value), BSRP Trigger Frames can be used as Initial Control Frames for EMLSR clients
- (wifi) Each MSDU, A-MSDU or management MPDU now has its individual frame retry count and each Txop/QosTxop has its own SRC (Station Retry Count) to match the standard specifications.
- (wifi) The `MaxSsrc` and `MaxSlrc` attributes of the `WifiRemoteStationManager` have been obsoleted and replaced by the `FrameRetryLimit` attribute of the `WifiMac`.
- (wifi) Added the `IncrementRetryCountUnderBa` attribute to the  `WifiRemoteStationManager` to choose whether or not to increase the retry count of frames that are part of a block ack agreement; this attribute defaults to false to match the standard specifications.
- (wifi) Added a new `BaEstablished` trace source to `QosTxop` to notify that a block ack agreement has been established with a given recipient for a given TID.
- (wifi) Added a new `MainPhySwitch` trace source to EmlsrManager, which is fired when the main PHY switches channel to operate on another link and provides information about the reason for starting the switch.
- (wifi) Add support for exchanging 802.11be Multi-Link Probe Request frames. Currently, the default association manager does not instruct the MAC to transmit a Multi-Link Probe Request frame, though.
- (wifi) 2004! - Add Wi-Fi channel occupancy statistics helper
- (wifi) 2009! - Added WifiTxStatsHelper for Wi-Fi MAC-level tracing.
- (wifi) - Added support for 802.11aa groupcast with retries (GCR). Both unsolicited retries (GCR-UR) and Block Ack (GCR-BA) mechanisms are implemented.
- (zigbee) Added a new Zigbee module.

This release is available from:
<https://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.25.tar.bz2>

### Supported platforms

- FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE (64 bit) with clang-3.4.1

### New user-visible features

- (internet) The native TCP implementation has been refactored, for the
  following improvements:
  - congestion control has been aligned with the Linux architecture,
    to facilitate easier coding of new congestion control algorithms
    or porting implementations from the Linux kernel,
  - Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery algorithms, compliant to RFCs, are
    shared by all TCP variants, unlike previous releases.
  - TCP Hybla and TCP HighSpeed variants have been added.

- (routing) The PrintRoutingTable* functions now print the following information
  each time they are called:
  - the node ID,
  - the global time,
  - the local time (allowing for future introduction of per-node clocks),
  - the routing protocol type

- (traffic control) A traffic control sublayer has been added with the aim of
  introducing an equivalent of the Linux Traffic +Control infrastructure into
  ns-3. This layer sits in between the NetDevices (L2) and the network
  protocol (e.g. IP). It is in charge of processing packets and performing
  actions on them: scheduling, dropping, marking, policing, etc.  Initial
  support for flow control has been added to the PointToPointNetDevice;
  backward-compatible support for other device types is provided.

- (traffic control) A three band priority queue modelled after Linux
  pfifo_fast queueing discipline has been added.

- (traffic control) Adaptive RED extensions have been added to the RED model

- (wifi) A number of changes related to improving support for 802.11n/ac
  models have been introduced.
  - Two rate controls compatible with High Throughput (HT) Wi-Fi modes
    (e.g. 802.11n/ac), Ideal and MinstrelHT, have been added
  - Support for multiple spatial streams (MIMO) using existing SISO
    error models
  - The WiFi helper API for the WifiMac sublayer, and the configuration
    of HT modes and parameters, has been simplified
  - Better support for backward compatibility with legacy modes

- (wifi) 802.11g was made backward compatible with 802.11b networks

- (internet) L4 protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) can be demultiplexed
  by IP according to the incoming interface. In other words, it is now
  possible to use specialized L4 protocols according to the interface.

- (internet) Ipv6Address::IsAllHostsMulticast() is now deprecated.
  FF02::3 is not in the official reserved IPv6 multicast address list.

- (internet) Ipv6Address::IsAll[Nodes,Routers]Multicast() now checks the
  address scope beyond the simple link-local. Nodes are checked for
  Interface-Local, Link-Local and Realm-Local, Routers for the above plus
  Site-Local.

- (internet) Ipv6 routing protocols must now *not* forward packets to upper
  layers unless for extremey specific cases. The Ipv6L3protocol handles
  almost all the packets directed to the host.

- (internet) Ipv6 can now reject packets directed to an address not configured
  on the interface they are received from (Strong End System Model, RFC 1222).

- (internet) UDP and Ipv6 RAW sockets can now join Ipv6 multicast groups.
  Incoming packets will be filtered according to if there's a socket listening
  to that group. Source filtering is left to the application.

- (network) ns-3 is now capable of serializing cooked (SLL) headers. This is
  used in DCE to allow the generation of pcap directly readable by wireshark.

- (internet) It is now possible to set custom values for RipNg Link Down
  (standard is 16).

- (internet) permanent (static) NDISC entries can be created for IPv6

- (internet) IPv4 RIPv2 protocol model is now available.

## Release 3.22

### Availability

This release is available from:
<http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.22.tar.bz2>

### Supported platforms

This release has been tested on the following platforms:

- Fedora Core 21 (64 bit) with g++-4.9.2
- Ubuntu 14.10 (32 bit) with g++-4.9.1
- Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) with g++-4.8.2

- OS X Yosemite 10.10 with Xcode 6.1.1 and clang-600.0.56
- FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE (64 bit) with clang-3.4.1

### New user-visible features

- (wifi) Support for MPDU aggregation has been added to the wifi model,
  as well as a number of related example programs.
- (wifi) Added two combined power and rate control mechanisms to the
  wifi module.  The new mechanisms, PARF and APARF, are the first in the
  wifi module to jointly control transmission power and data rate.  Two use
  case examples (PowerAdaptationDistance and PowerAdaptationInterference)
  and a test case have also been added.
- (lte) In previous releases of the LTE module, the bearer release
  functionality was only partially supported. As an enhancement, a
  complete release bearer procedure is now implemented, which can be
  invoked by calling the new helper method
  LteHelper::DeActivateDedicatedEpsBearer(). The related output can be
  seen through the stats collected at different layers like PDCP, RLC,
  MAC, PHY. To support this implementation, an example and test suite is
  added within the LTE module examples and tests folder.
- (wave) Additional support has been added for WiFi-based vehicular networks,
  including the channel-access coordination features of IEEE 1609.4 and a
  comprehensive VANET routing example that includes a Basic Safety
  Message (BSM) packet generator application and associated statistics
  counters.  Together, these allow users to evaluate the performance effects
  in a VANET of varying transmission and channel properties (e.g., packet
  rate, message size, transmit power, propagation loss model, impact of
  routing protocol traffic, etc.).
- (internet) It is now possible to print the Neighbor Cache (ARP and NDISC)
  by using the RoutingProtocolHelper
- (stats) A new TimeProbe class has been added to hook the data collection
  framework to traced values emitting Time objects
- (documentation) the callback function signatures for all TraceSources
  is documented in Doxygen
- (utils) print-introspected-doxygen.cc has had several enhancements;
  use -h to read the usage message for details.
- (core) TracedValue and TracedCallback function signatures are now documented,
  which required changing the TypeId::AddTraceSource API.

- OS X Mavericks 10.9 with Xcode 5.1.1 and clang-503.0.40
- FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE (64 bit) with clang-3.3

### New user-visible features

- The LTE module now supports the transport of the S1-U, X2-U and X2-C
  interfaces over emulated links via the new helper class EmuEpcHelper.
- CommandLine can now provide a shorthand argument name for any
  Attribute.
- Implemented support for Frequency Reuse algorithms in LTE module, as the
  outcome of GSoC 2014 project.
  The project also includes several sub-features, such as:
  - implementation of Downlink Power Control
  - implementation of Uplink Power Control
  - new DL-CQI generation approach, which increases throughput if FR algorithms
    are used
  - seven options of Frequency Reuse algorithms: LteFrNoOpAlgorithm,
    LteFrHardAlgorithm, LteFrStrictAlgorithm, LteFrSoftAlgorithm,
    LteFfrSoftAlgorithm, LteFfrEnhancedAlgorithm, LteFfrDistributedAlgorithm
  - updated RadioEnvironmentMapHelper. Now RadioEnvironmentMap can be generated
    for Data or Control channel and for specified RbId, what is helpful when
    using FR algorithms
- Added a CoDel queue model.  CoDel queues measure and control the queue
  traversal delay.  The ns-3 implementation is a port of the Linux
  implementation.
- Added support for TCP timestamp and window scale options, and added
  ability to trace the TCP slow start threshold value.
- SimpleNetDevice and SimpleChannel (used for adding basic link effects
  for testing of higher-layer protocols) have been extended to support
  the option of broadcast or PointToPoint link semantics.  The bandwidth
  and link delay can be constrained, and it uses an output queue.
- SimpleNetDevice and SimpleChannel can be installed in a node through
  a new helper: SimpleNetDeviceHelper.
- Implemented new PacketSocketServer and PacketSocketClient applications.
  The primary use is in tests, to avoid using the ones from the
  application module that also bring in a dependency on the internet module.

## Release 3.19

### Availability

This release is available from:
<http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.19.tar.bz2>

### Supported platforms

These platforms have been tested; others may work also:

- Fedora Core 19 (32/64 bit) with g++-4.8.1
- Ubuntu 13.10 (64 bit) with g++-4.8.1

### New user-visible features

- Extension to UE measurements and improved handover algorithm models in LTE
  module, as the outcome of GSoC 2013 project. The project also includes several
  sub-features, such as:
  - implementation of System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1);
  - a new option for automatic UE attachment using Idle mode cell selection
    procedure;
  - improved configurability of UE measurements; and
  - two options of handover algorithms for enabling automatic handover trigger
    in LTE simulation: A2-A4-RSRQ and strongest cell (A3-RSRP).

- A new FixedRoomPositionAllocator has been added to the buildings
  module. It allows one to generate a random position uniformly
  distributed in the volume of a chosen room inside a chosen building.

- A new attribute ns3::LteRlcAm::TxOpportunityForRetxAlwaysBigEnough
  allows to overcome the lack for re-segmentation in the RLC AM
  implementation by assuming that the size of a TxOpportunity is
  always big enough for the RLC AM PDU to be retransmitted.

- After some profiling, the code of LteMiErrorModel has been optimized
  for speed, resulting in a significantly lower execution time of the
  LTE model when used with the error model enabled.

- A new WiFi extension for vehicular simulation support is available in
  the src/wave directory.  The current code represents an interim capability
  to realize an IEEE 802.11p-compliant device, but without the WAVE
  extensions (which are planned for a later patch).  The WaveNetDevice
  modelled herein enforces that a WAVE-compliant physical layer (at 5.9 GHz)
  is selected, and does not require any association between devices (similar
  to an adhoc WiFi MAC), but is otherwise similar (at this time) to a
  WifiNetDevice.  WAVE capabililties of switching between control and
  service channels, or using multiple radios, are not yet modelled.

- A new IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) model
  is available.  Using ns-3's naming convention, the acronym is expanded
  to SixLowPanNetDevice.   The SixLowPanNetDevice is able to act as a
  shim between IPv6 and a NetDevice, compressing IPv6 headers according
  to RFCs 4944 and 6262.  The SixLowPanNetDevice is meant to be used over
  IEEE 802.15.4 NetDevices, but it can be used on other NetDevices as
  well (see the manual for full details).  This model precedes the
  general availability of an 802.15.4 model, so must be run in conjunction
  with a wired NetDevice model for now, or with experimental versions of
  802.15.4 models.

- It is now possible to use Ipv6PacketInfoTag from UDP applications in the
  same way as with Ipv4PacketInfoTag. See Doxygen for current limitations in
  using Ipv[4,6]PacketInfoTag to set IP properties.

- Ipv[4,6]Interfaces not respecting the minimum MTU requirements (68 octets
  for IPv4 and 1280 octets for IPv6) will be automatically set as Down.

- IPv6 addresses and routing tables are printed in a more conventional way,
  closely matching the Linux "route -A inet6" command.

- Additional time units (Year, Day, Hour, Minute) were added to the time
  value class that represents simulation time; the largest unit prior to
  this addition was Second.

- A new parallel scheduling algorithm based on null messages, a common
  parallel DES scheduling algorithm, has been added.  The null message
  scheduler has better scaling properties when running on some scenarios
  with large numbers of nodes since it does not require a global
  communication.

### New user-visible features

- A new random variable base class called `RandomVariableStream`, has been
  introduced.  This base class derives from `ns3::Object`, unlike the current
  `RandomVariable` class which is a special type of object in the ns-3
  system to date.  By making this class derive from `ns3::Object`, it can be
  handled with the Ptr class, can carry attributes, and can have its parameters
  and initial state saved in the config-store subsystem.  A new attribute
  called `Stream` has been introduced for this class, to allow users to
  better control the assignment of underlying pseudo-random sequences to
  the `RandomVariableStream` objects (bug 101).

### New user-visible features

- Transport protocol implementations (TCP, UDP) have been refactored to
  support also IPv6 connections. Dual-stacked IPv6 sockets are implemented.
  An IPv6 socket can accept an IPv4 connection, returning the sender's
  address as an IPv4-mapped address (IPV6_V6ONLY socket option is not
  implemented).
- The LTE code from the LENA project has been merged, bringing in a
  significant redesign of the LTE module as well as many new features.
- An antenna module is now included, which includes different
  radiation pattern models. See the corresponding new section of the
  ns-3 models library documentation for details.
- A new buildings module is introduced which allows to model the
  presence of buildings in a wireless network topology.
- New propagation models (OkumuraHata, ITU-R P.1411, ITU-R P.1238)
  have been added
- The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) MANET routing protocol for IPv4 was added.
- A Random Early Detection (RED) queue model has been added.
- Ipv6RoutingHelper is now in-line with Ipv4RoutingHelper concerning the RT
  print functions. Various minor changes were made in Ipv6RoutingProtocol and
  derived classes to make this possible.
- New "SendIcmpv6Redirect" attribute (and getter/setter functions) to
  Ipv6L3Protocol. The behavior is similar to Linux's conf "send_redirects",
  i.e., enable/disable the ICMPv6 Redirect sending.
- Longer and more descriptive names are used for error units in RateErrorModel
  class and queue mode in Queue class. Attributes in those classes are also
  changed for consistency. See API documentation for details.
- The netanim animator is now bundled with the release.

### New user-visible features

- SpectrumChannel models now support the usage of single-frequency
  propagation loss models based on the PropagationLossModel
  class. These model can be used in conjunction with
  the frequency-dependent propagation loss model based on the
  SpectrumPropagationLossModel class already supported by
  SpectrumChannel.

## Release 3.11

### Availability

This release is available from:
<http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.11.tar.bz2>

### Supported platforms

ns-3.11 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Linux x86_64 Ubuntu 11.04
  - g++-4.5.2
- Linux i686 Ubuntu 11.04
  - g++-4.5.2, g++-4.4.5

- OS X Snow Leopard
  - g++-4.2.1

### New user-visible features

- The build system has been modularized, and the source code reorganized,
  to allow for modular libraries instead of a single monolithic ns-3
  library.   User programs now link a number of smaller, per-module
  libraries depending on the dependencies expressed to the build system.
  Source code is now being maintained in individual modules with
  consistent directory structures.

- Python bindings have also been modularized, and the bindings are now
  generated into a 'ns' namespace instead of 'ns3' for the old
  (monolithic) bindings.  By default the bindings are now modular, with
  a backward compatibility layer for older programs.

- By default, example and test programs are disabled from the build.
  Users can enable them via the use of a waf command at configure time,
  or automatically through the use of a new .ns3rc file.

- int64x64_t is a new type which allows portable and easy to write arithmetic
  calculations that require a high degree of fractional precision.

- An interface to the Click Modular Router and an Ipv4ClickRouting
  class has been added, to allow a node to use Click for external routing.

- An interface to an OpenFlow software implementation distribution has
  been added to allow the simulation of OpenFlow switches in ns-3.

- ns-3 coding style requirements have been applied to the entire coding
  base, resulting in a large number of whitespace changes.  The coding
  style has been automatically enforced by running a style checking
  program (utils/check-style.py) that uses the uncrustify (v. 0.58)
  program to apply changes.

- Some documentation reorganization to split documentation between
  the ns-3 manual (primarily focusing on the ns-3 core) and a new
  "model library" document has been started.

## Release 3.10

### Availability

This release is available from:
<http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.10.tar.bz2>

### Supported platforms

ns-3.10 has been tested on the following platforms.  Not all features are
available on all platforms; check the Installation page on the project wiki.

- Linux i686 Ubuntu 10.10
  - g++-4.4.5

  - g++-4.2.1
- OS X powerpc Leopard
  - g++-4.0, g++-4.2

### New user-visible features

- NS-3 PyViz, a live simulation visualizer, has been added.  The
  visualizer interacts with a running simulation, such that it uses no
  trace files. It can be most useful for debugging purposes, i.e. to
  figure out if mobility models are what you expect, where packets are
  being dropped, etc. There is also a builtin interactive python console
  that can be used to debug the state of the running objects. Although
  it is mostly written in Python, it works both with Python and pure C++
  simulations.

- Wi-Fi MAC high classes have been reorganised in attempt to
  consolidate shared functionality into a single class. This new
  class is RegularWifiMac, and it derives from the abstract
  WifiMac, and is parent of AdhocWifiMac, StaWifiMac, ApWifiMac,
  and MeshWifiInterfaceMac. The QoS and non-QoS class variants are
  no longer, with a RegularWifiMac attribute "QosSupported"
  allowing selection between these two modes of
  operation.

- Support for IEEE 802.11g (specifically, rates with Modulation
  Class ERP-OFDM) has been added to the wifi module. The new
  WifiModes have names of the form ErpOfdmRatexxMbps, where xx is
  the rate in Mbps (one of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54), and a
  WifiPhyStandard enumeration WIFI_PHY_STANDARD_80211g has been
  added to allow configuration of a Wi-Fi STA supporting ERP-OFDM,
  HR/DSSS, and DSSS rates (which some call an "802.11b/g" station).

- Two attributes were added to WaypointMobilityModel.  The first
  "LazyNotify" (default false), if enabled to true, will suppress
  course change notifications if there are no position updates.
  The second, "InitialPositionIsWaypoint" (default false), if enabled,
  will allow an initial call to SetPosition () (before any waypoints
  have been added) to be treated as the first waypoint.

- Regression testing is now completely performed within test.py
  rather than a separate "./waf --regression" that consults
  reference traces in the ns-3.x-ref-traces directory.  In most
  cases, the example programs whose traces were included in
  ns-3.x-ref-traces have a corresponding test called from the
  test.py program.  It is still possible to write trace-based
  regression tests but they are now called from the test.py
  program.

- New BulkSendApplication sends data as fast as possible up to
  MaxBytes or unlimited if MaxBytes is zero.  Think OnOff, but
  without the "off" and without the variable data rate. This
  application only works with SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET
  sockets, for example TCP sockets and not UDP sockets.

- Extensions to the energy models:  1) a new Rakhmatov Vrudhula
  non-linear battery model, 2) additional support for modeling
  energy consumption in WiFi devices, 3) an example for how to add
  energy models to a WiFi-based simulation (in examples/energy/
  directory).

- New methods to print IPv4 routing tables to an output stream.

- A replacement implementation for TCP for IPv4.  TcpSocketBase
  now replaces TcpSocketImpl.  There are subclasses defined for
  TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and the original RFC793 without
  congestion control.

- Energy support for UAN module and Li-Ion energy model.
  Now each network node can have an associated energy source
  from which it consumes energy. The user can specify a custom
  energy model for the underwater transducer, with default values
  set for WHOI acoustic transducer. Li-Ion battery model added
  into energy models folder.

- Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol
  is a proactive, table-driven routing protocol for MANETs
  developed by Charles E. Perkins and Pravin Bhagwat in 1994.
  This implementation is for IPv4 routing and was contributed
  by ResilNets Research Group.

- A novel model to simulate LTE networks has been added.  It focuses
  mainly on modeling the E-UTRA part of the system, with a particular
  attention on the aspects related to the channel, PHY and MAC layers.
  The most important features available at this moment are (i) a basic
  implementation of both the UE and the eNB devices, (ii) RRC and
  entities for both the UE and the eNB, (iii) an Adaptive Modulation
  and Coding (AMC) scheme for the downlink, (iv) the management of the
  data radio bearers (with their QoS parameters), the MAC queues and
  the RLC instances, (v) Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) management,
  (vi) support for both uplink and downlik packet scheduling,
  (vii) a PHY layer model with Resource Block level granularity, and
  (viii) a channel model with the outdoor E-UTRAN propagation loss
  model.

- Project documentation has been converted from GNU Texinfo to Sphinx.

Not all ns-3 options are available on all platforms; consult the
wiki for more information:
<http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation>

### New user-visible features

- A reorganisation of the construction of Wi-Fi transmit rates has
  been undertaken with the aim of simplifying the task of
  supporting further IEEE 802.11 PHYs. This work has been completed
  under the auspices of Bug 871. A consequence of this work is that
  WifiModes have a new (hopefully future-proof) naming, and
  simulations which specify rates by name will need updating. The
  list of new rate names is given in the error message produced
  when an attempt is made to use any invalid rate name (including
  those that were previously valid).

- A new OFDM error rate model for WiFi (NistErrorRateModel); this model
  has been validated in clear-channel testbed tests.  For 802.11b, it
  uses the same underlying model as the YansErrorRateModel, but it differs
  from YansErrorRateModel for OFDM modes (802.11a/g).  The default
  YansWifiPhyHelper has been changed to use this model.

- A new NS-2 mobility trace reader supports BonnMotion, SUMO, TraNS,
  etc. traces.

- An energy model for nodes and devices, including an energy source
  model and device energy models allowing energy-aware devices
  to notify the energy source about energy consumption.

- Rocketfuel topology dataset support for existing topology reader
  Rocketfuel project:
  <http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel/>

- Underwater Acoustic Network (UAN) model, split in to three parts, the
  channel, PHY, and MAC models to enable researchers to model a variety
  of underwater network scenarios.

- the Spectrum framework, which provides support for spectrum-aware
  Channel and PHY layer modeling. It features a set of classes that
  allows the mathematical representation of frequency dependent
  phenomena. Some example channel, propagation and device
  implementations that make use of this framework are also
  included.

### What is ns-3?

ns-3 is a new discrete-event network simulator designed for supporting network
research and education. ns-3 features a solid, well documented C++ core and
models for TCP/IP (IPv4), several link types including WiFi, and mobility
models.

ns-3 is an open source project released under the GNU GPLv2 license which
allows anyone to use ns-3 without having to pay any license fee or royalties.
ns-3 is actively seeking new contributors to extend the range of supported
models and/or to maintain existing models.

Warning: among API changes in this release, Application::Start and
Application::Stop now interprets the time argument as a relative
instead of absolute simulation time, to align with how Simulator::Schedule
behaves.  Any code that calls these APIs in the middle of the simulation
will need to be adapted.

The API of Simulator::StopAt (time) has also changed.  Now it is
called Simulator::Stop (time), and takes a relative time, instead of
absolute.
